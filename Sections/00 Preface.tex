\section*{Preface}
This article was written for the subject TMM4540 - Industrial ICT Engineering Design And Materials, Specialization Project. 

The development of ATO at NTNU has been in progress for multiple years and is now in the remote operation phase. Master students at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering has steadily worked on this project. In the fall of 2024 and spring of 2025 it was from Emilia Kozarevic, and I will continue her and NTNU's research on the topic.

I have had no previous experience about ATO. But subject \& knowledge listed below has been used.
\begin{itemize}
    \item TBA4225 - Railway Engineering 2
    \item IT2810  - Web Development
    \item TDT4240 - Software Architecture
    \item TDT4120 - Algorithms and Data Structures
\end{itemize}


I would like to end the preface by thanking Nils Olsson for the work of supervising me during this semester and the effort he has put in to help me write this paper. I also would like to thank Patrick Urassa (NTNU) and Tomas Rosberg from VTI for discussing and the insight in the project.

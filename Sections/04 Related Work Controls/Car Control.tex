\subsection{Car Control}

\subsubsection{Ouden 2022}

The paper \cite{ouden2022} investigates how remote driving performs over commercial 4G and 5G networks. Its purpose is to evaluate whether current mobile networks can support safe remote control of vehicles at low speeds. The authors design a complete remote-driving architecture with vehicles, remote stations, fleet management, and a 5G mobile-edge setup. They test the system both in Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations and in real field trials using straight-line braking and slalom manoeuvres. The study measures position accuracy, reaction time effects, and communication latency, comparing 4G and 5G performance. Results show that 5G halves network latency compared to 4G and that overall network performance is sufficient for remote driving below 40 km/h, although total reaction delay is still dominated by video processing and human reaction time rather than the network itself.

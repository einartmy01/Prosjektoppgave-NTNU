\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Level 0:} Applies to trains equipped for ETCS, but there is no ETCS trackside. Effectivly going back to regular control and legacy signalling.
  \item \textbf{Level STM:} Applies to trains equipped for ETCS, but runs on tracks with national system with ATP. Allowing ETCS to interface for the ATP
  \item \textbf{Level 1:} Spot transmission threw Eurobalises providing intermittent movement authorities and speed control while legacy signalling remain in place.

  \item \textbf{Level 2:} Continuous radio exchange to Radio Block Centre (RBC), typically via GSM-R or a successor. Movement authority is provided by the RBC. Eurobalises, if used, are primarily for precise positioning. Legacy signalling system are no longer needed and optional.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Round-Trip Time (RTT):} Refers to the total time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination and back again to the source. It is commonly used to assess the overall latency of a network connection.
   
  \item \textbf{One-Way Delay (OWD):} Refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination in one direction. This measurement is particularly important for applications requiring real-time responsiveness, such as train control systems.
  
  \item \textbf{Glass to Glass (G2G):} Refers to the total latency from the moment a signal is generated until the corresponding action is observed. This measurement includes image capture, encoding, transmission, decoding and displaying.
  
  \item \textbf{End to End (E2E):} E2E can vary depending on papers, but most refers to the total latency from the initial source of a command or data packet to its final destination, including all intermediate processing and transmission steps. This measurement includes G2G as well as operator response time, sending control signals,  transmission time and system processing delays.

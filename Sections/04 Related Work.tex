\subsection{Other Experiences}
Experiences from other simialar fields, self driving cars, drones, maybe other remote controlled trains in different countries

\subsubsection{Train Control}
In accordance to UITP, of all fully automated metro lines, 87\% use CBTC (communications based train control) \cite{uitp2018metro}

As mentionted in ERA's ERTMS. Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/919 of 27 May 2016 on the technical specification for 
interoperability relating to the ‘control-command and signalling’ subsystems of the rail system in the European Union \cite{era_ertms}

\subsubsection{ATO-Cargo Project}
The ATO-Cargo project, led by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with DB Cargo AG, Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD), and ProRail B.V., focuses on developing and testing highly automated technologies for freight trains. The goal is to enhance rail freight efficiency by optimizing speed profiles, improving route utilization, and increasing competitiveness with road transport \cite{dlr2025atocargo}.

A key component of the project is the integration of an Automatic Train Operation (ATO) unit on locomotives in combination with the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2. This setup allows for real-time automation while maintaining human oversight. In case of system malfunctions or degraded operation, human operators at a Remote Supervision and Control Centre (RSC) can take over tasks such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and manual control. 

The project also emphasizes human factors engineering, ensuring that the RSC is ergonomically designed for operator efficiency and safety. For this project, researchers have employ virtual reality tools to simulate realistic control room environments and train personnel for future remote supervision tasks. Tests are being conducted on Betuweroute, a freight only railway, linking Rotterdam and the Ruhr region to validate the technical and operational readiness of this automation concept. The ultimate goal is to establish a European reference model for automated freight train operation \cite{dlr2025atocargo}.

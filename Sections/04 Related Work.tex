\textit{Going to hold on Sato and Nakamura too see if needed}
\subsubsection{Sato 2021}
%https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9575817
Base of 150 ms
buffer time of 150, 200, 400. (ignoring base)

Showing latency improved performance on every latency
The improvement increased as well for higher latency
150     200     400
14->3,  8->6,   7->6

\subsubsection{Nakamura 2021}

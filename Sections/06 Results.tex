\section{Results og discussion}
A page with all the test, how and what and the results.

\subsection{Human factors results}
Discuss how a high stable latency could be more acceptable than a low unstable latency due to info found in Theory, Human Factors.

\cite{jernberg2024latency}
This article conlcude that the remote operators adapt to the circumstances. Adding safety margins adjusted for their personal limit.

\subsection{Comparment of latency for different vehicles}


Important to mention the hazards and proxy hazards that driving met on:
\cite{jernberg2024latency}
That was
H1/P1: Car pulling over into your lane.
H2/P2: Car crossing from opposing lane threw your lane.
H3/P3: Car with "vikeplikt" does not stop in crossing.
H4/P4: Child runs into traffic from behind a bus.
H5/P5: Bicycal in lane that driver needs to pass in oppsing lane.

How in control of the vehicle were you during the drive (1-5)
Baseline 3.7, 100ms 3.5, 200ms 2.9


\subsection{Threshold for acceptable latency}

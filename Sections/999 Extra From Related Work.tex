    \item \textbf{Protocols Used (and reasons, if stated)} \\
    The system currently uses \textbf{TCP} for communication between server and vehicle, prioritizing reliability for control commands, Heartbeat integrity, and safe data transfer. For the livestream, TCP is used in the prototype for stability, though the report notes that \textbf{UDP} may become preferable on cellular networks due to lower latency. Communication between components relies on Python sockets, JSON-encoded messages, and OpenCV for video handling \cite{jürgensen2025rcrailvehicles}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Protocols Used} \\
    RTSP and WebRTC are compared, both running on RTP/RTCP. RTP provides low-latency transport, and RTCP supplies the metrics used for bitrate adaptation. RTSP is highlighted as more suitable when several users must access the same stream.

\paragraph{Additional extracted points:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Protocols Used} \\
    The video stream uses H.264 encoding, with command-and-control messages carried over mobile 4G/5G networks. No additional transport protocols are discussed in detail .

\paragraph{Protocols used}
The paper evaluates video transmission using RTSP over both TCP and UDP. Tests include H.264 and MJPEG encoding, with direct connections to the camera as well as server–client forwarding setups for measuring one-way transport delay. TCP introduces retransmissions and higher jitter, while UDP provides lower delay but without delivery guarantees. }

\cite{kang2018}
\paragraph{Protocols used}
The streaming setup uses UDP to transmit H.264- or MPEG-4 encoded video frames from the vehicle to the server. The server decompresses frames using a GStreamer pipeline. LTE and Wi-Fi are used as transport networks, but no additional communication protocols are implemented beyond UDP for frame delivery. 

\cite{gonzález2023}
\paragraph{Protocols used}
Telemetry and command/control use MAVLink over TCP. Video is transmitted with RTP encapsulated in UDP, encoded with H.264. Additional tools such as ffmpeg and GStreamer are used to process and forward video in different connection schemes. Also uses URLLC.

\cite{larsen2022}
\paragraph{Protocols used}
The fronthaul assumes Ethernet transport using eCPRI to carry 5G split-7.2x traffic. All latency modelling is based on Ethernet frames traversing multiple switches with strict-priority scheduling or Time-Aware Shaping (TAS). No application-layer protocols are used, as the study focuses on transport-layer behaviour rather than drone-specific command or video formats. 

\cite{böhmer2020}
\paragraph{Protocols used}
The communication system uses Wi-Fi with IPv4, UDP, and the Predictably Reliable Real-time Transport (PRRT) protocol to carry control messages. Internally, the drone still uses CRTP over UART, while video streaming relies on GStreamer pipelines with H.264 encoding sent through PRRT.

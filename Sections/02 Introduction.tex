\subsection{Digitalization in Railway}
Railway digitalization evolved from early computer-assisted signalling and centralized traffic control, through modern Automatic Train Protection (ATP) systems, to full ERTMS/ETCS deployments and traffic management platforms. Recent steps have focused on communication-based train control (CBTC) in metros, ETCS rollout on mainlines, and the integration of predictive maintenance and data analytics tools. Projects such as national ETCS rollouts, the UK East Coast Digital Programme, and research initiatives like ATO-Cargo exemplify a shift from isolated automation pilots to system-wide modernization that combines ATO, interoperability standards (TSIs), and remote supervision concepts \cite{era_tsi, dlr2025atocargo}.

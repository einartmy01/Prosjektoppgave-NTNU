\section{Conclusion}
\textit{But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright Brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown} -  \textcite{sagan_1993}.

\section{Example Section}

In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations, named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.

\eqref{eq:Incompressible Navier-Stokes} shows the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using tensor notation.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j^2}
    \label{eq:Incompressible Navier-Stokes}
\end{equation}
